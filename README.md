# AirPollution-Analysis-SatelliteImagery

Understanding Air Pollution Using Satellite Imagery is a project that explores persistent air pollution levels in India despite various control measures. The project focuses on analyzing satellite data to compare pollutant levels across Indian cities, particularly highlighting differences before and after Diwali

Key components include:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing satellite data for analysis.
- Visualization: Generating maps and graphs to represent pollution levels.
- Analysis: Understanding air quality trends using Python tools.
  
This project demonstrates how technology and data can aid in addressing real-world problems like air pollution.
