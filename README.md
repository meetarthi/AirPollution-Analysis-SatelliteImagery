# AirPollution-Analysis-SatelliteImagery
----------------------------------
This repository features the code and resources used in my talk at Chennaipy's November 2024 meetup, titled "Understanding Air Pollution using Satellite Imagery".

The project explores the potential of satellite data in analyzing air pollution levels and identifying patterns across regions. By preprocessing satellite imagery and leveraging visualization tools, it highlights insights that contribute to understanding environmental challenges.

Key components include:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing satellite data for analysis.
- Visualization: Generating maps and graphs to represent pollution levels.
- Analysis: Understanding air quality trends using Python tools.
  
This project demonstrates how technology and data can aid in addressing real-world problems like air pollution.
